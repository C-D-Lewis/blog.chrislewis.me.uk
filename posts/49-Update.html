I've embarked upon my fourth and final year at university, and so a lot of my time is taken up with the course and associated course-work, including a mammoth individual research project.

The good news is that a large part of that project will involve writing software in C++, which I've never used before. I have, however, used C so the leap is not too far. Thus over the last week or so I've been gaining familiarity with using the <a title="OpenCV" href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV</a> image processing library and after the initial teething troubles installing and linking the library it looks very promising for what I hope to achieve.

In the free time remaining when I'm not doing other life stuff, I've been working on a much more polished <a title="Android App: GClient (Working Title)" href="http://ninedof.wordpress.com/2013/07/25/android-app-gclient-working-title/">GClient</a> using the knowledge I obtained working on Watch Trigger, as well as trying to figure out why zoom isn't working in a test build of Watch Trigger +. Yet more wresting with the finicky Camera API.

Hopefully I'll crack it soon!
