Here's a preview of something interesting I've been working on. All I'll say right now (until I have more to show) is that is uses my newest multi-threaded, TCP enabled Java 2D game engine, and it's like having a model railway on your PC. And after swapping a few <code>BufferedImages</code> for <code>Bitmaps</code>, possibly in your pocket!

![](http://ninedof.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/preview1.png?w=545)Summary of features so far:


	- Sixteen types of placeable track (straight, curves, crossrails, points)
	- A depot with GUI that enables creation of services from the top left
	- Intelligent navigation of all track and points, including stop signals
	- Text file saving/loading of complete maps, except services.


More details soon!
