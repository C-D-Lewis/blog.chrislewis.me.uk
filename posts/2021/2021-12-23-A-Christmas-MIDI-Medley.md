It's been a few months since the
[original post](https://blog.chrislewis.me.uk/?post=2021-06-05-Making-MIDI-Music-With-Raspberry-Pi-Pico)
covering my
[pico-pipes](https://github.com/c-d-lewis/pico-pipes) MIDI organ that uses four
stepper motors to create music via C++ compiled from the MIDI files themselves.

As Christmas is not far away, I found myself tinkering with this year's
projects and had the idea to record a new medley of Christmassy songs (and one
not-so-Christmassy bonus song).

Enjoy, and Merry Christmas for 2021!
