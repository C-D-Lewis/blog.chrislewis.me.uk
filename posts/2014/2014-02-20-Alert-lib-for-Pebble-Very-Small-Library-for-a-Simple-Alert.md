In making improvements to <a title="Wristponder for Pebble: Send Custom SMS Messages from your wrist!" href="http://ninedof.wordpress.com/2014/02/14/wristponder-for-pebble-send-custom-sms-messages-from-your-wrist/">Wristponder</a>, I developed a mechanism that I've gone on to make into a small library that I'll doubtless reuse again in the future, as can you!

![](/assets/import/media/2014/02/example_screenshot.png)To use, simply copy the files into your /src folder, <code>#include "alert.h"</code> and call <code>alert_show(...)</code>. You can also update an existing alert and cancel at any time.

The full details as well as an example project are on the <a title="Source code!" href="https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/pebble-alert-lib">GitHub page here</a>. Enjoy!
