The Data Toggle for Pebble Android app has been updated and is now version 1.1.0. The changes are as below:

• Added an option to install from Pebble Appstore.

• Added rating link to Google Play store page.

The main motivation behind this small update is to enable Pebble SDK 2.0 Beta 10 users work around the existing sideloading bug where my current install method of a .pbw from the bundled assets folder stops working. I'm not too concerned now the Pebble Appstore link is in place, and they have assured me a fix is in the works:
