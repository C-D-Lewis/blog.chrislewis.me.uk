<code>INCOMING TRANSMISSION FROM DEEP ROCK GALACTIC CENTRAL COMMAND</code>

```textwrap
Listen up, miners! Management has seen fit to outfit you with the latest device from R&D - a wrist-mounted display. Apparently the standard mission timer wasn't enough to keep you on time and on budget.

You'll find the stats you need to get your job done:

- Battery level

- Progress to daily step goal

- Time and date

- Total steps and total calories burned today

And I'm told there's also one other special feature to find, in case you forget why we do what we do... Use it wisely.

Once you receive your unit, make sure to update the firmware with the link below:

Good luck, and don't let a Nemesis grab it off you...

Rock and stone.
