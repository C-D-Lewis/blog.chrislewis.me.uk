It's been some time since the last post and now some new apps are available! The lineup now includes:


	- Upcoming - A simple card-based app that shows the title, description, time, and date of the next ten events on your primary Google calendar.
	- News Headlines - A new design for the tried and true News Headlines app on Pebble (one of my oldest), which re-uses the card UI built for Upcoming.


Since both these new apps use the same layout and code style, I'm considering perhaps trying to make it into a UI framework that can be easily reused with other data sets... Perhaps one for the future.

These apps were the two I was most looking forward to having completed on FitBit, since one replaces the extremely important ability to quickly see what meetings I have coming up that I got from Pebble timeline, and the other enables me to stay vaguely up to date with the world (this weekend's wedding excepting!) in small glimpses.

So what's next? As mentioned in the last post, I'd like to try and get back to basics with some new watchface concepts, and also explore the possibility of beginning to bring some Dashboard functionality to FitBIt, depending on which data is available. I'm thinking web APIs for networks and battery level to get started, but sadly no actuation for the time being.

As always, you can see the code for yourself [on GitHub](http://github.com/C-D-Lewis/fitbit-dev).
