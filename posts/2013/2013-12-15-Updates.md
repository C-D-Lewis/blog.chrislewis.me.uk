So now the semester has finished, I can get down to some real coding and tutorial writing. Things to expect over the next few weeks:

• More parts of the Pebble SDK 2.0 Tutorial.

• Information on a basic Pebble rendering engine.

• A small post on my recently acquired Spark Core.

In other news, the latest versions of Watch Trigger (2.3) and Watch Trigger + (1.5) have been sent to Google Play, fixing xx-hdpi display issues and a bug when opening the front camera on the LG Nexus 5.

Stay tuned!
