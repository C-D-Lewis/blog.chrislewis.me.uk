<strong>In an almost biblical revelation, I have found it IS indeed possible to post source code in a proper fashion on Wordpress, making a virtual mockery of my Pebble SDK Tutorial pages, which I might update, but not for now. The code segments are available in source links in each post.

So, what better reason to make a new post using this newly discovered feature than to write about my latest Raspberry Pi escapade. I have a cheap <a title="HCSR04" href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/30209">HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor</a> that I used with an Ultrasonic library with my Arduino. Having since obtained a Pi, why not have it work with this new piece of kit?

After observing the <a title="Timing Requirements (Page 2)" href="http://jaktek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/HC-SR04.pdf">timing requirements</a>, it seemed simple enough to replicate that behavior with a short C program, shown below in all it's copyable glory!

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <wiringPi.h>

#define TRUE 1

#define TRIG 5
#define ECHO 6

void setup() {
        wiringPiSetup();
        pinMode(TRIG, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(ECHO, INPUT);

        //TRIG pin must start LOW
        digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW);
        delay(30);
}

int getCM() {
        //Send trig pulse
        digitalWrite(TRIG, HIGH);
        delayMicroseconds(20);
        digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW);

        //Wait for echo start
        while(digitalRead(ECHO) == LOW);

        //Wait for echo end
        long startTime = micros();
        while(digitalRead(ECHO) == HIGH);
        long travelTime = micros() - startTime;

        //Get distance in cm
        int distance = travelTime / 58;

        return distance;
}

int main(void) {
        setup();

        printf("Distance: %dcm\n", getCM());

        return 0;
}
```

Which results in this output:

So now I know the distance to the ceiling!
