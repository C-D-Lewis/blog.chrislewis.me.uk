So while the exams are going on, I don't have a lot of time for long coding sessions, but I am working on a small side project that builds on earlier work, and therefore requires minimal effort.

The idea is this: Modify the Java server to run <code>cmd</code> commands from my Android phone. First stage is creating a networking class for Android use. This could be useful for commands such as <code>shutdown</code> without having to use the slow TeamViewer app, for example. 

Here we go!
