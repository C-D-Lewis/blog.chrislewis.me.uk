Here's a preview of something interesting I've been working on. All I'll say right now (until I have more to show) is that is uses my newest multi-threaded, TCP enabled Java 2D game engine, and it's like having a model railway on your PC. And after swapping a few <code>BufferedImages</code> for <code>Bitmaps</code>, possibly in your pocket!

![](/assets/import/media/2013/06/preview1.png?w=545)Summary of features so far:

• Sixteen types of placeable track (straight, curves, crossrails, points)

• A depot with GUI that enables creation of services from the top left

• Intelligent navigation of all track and points, including stop signals

• Text file saving/loading of complete maps, except services.

More details soon!
