After receiving some encouraging comments from the Pebbler community, I've added some more details and branched out the Potential Divider watch face into two flavours: Small and Large text, for extra readability.

The install packages can be found at mypebblefaces.com: <a href="http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=3745&aName=Bonsitm&pageTitle=Potential+Divider&auID=3905">Small</a> and <a href="http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=3754&aName=Bonsitm&pageTitle=Potential+Divider+Large+Edition&auID=3905">Large</a>.

Source code for both faces can be <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/iuynpy0tn3reg9r/Divider%20Small%20and%20Large.zip?v=0mcn">found here</a>.
