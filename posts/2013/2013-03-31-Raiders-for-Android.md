After my breakthrough with the primitive game engine for Android in the last post, I've ported and adapted Raiders (still yet to write about!). I'll release it here once its faster, neater and more feature filled, but for now, here is an image!

Despite what the screenshot shows (I took it while debugging, which slows the phone down as it reports everything internal to the PC), the framerate I average on my fairly old Galaxy S is around 55 Frames Per Second. I can't wait to try it on a Galaxy S3.
