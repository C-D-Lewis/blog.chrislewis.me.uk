It's here! The redesign I've been planning since many months ago (the previous colour watchapp design was a bit of a bodge), and I've wanted to add in a few extra features:

 • GSM signal strength

 • Wifi network name

 • Phone free space

 • Resync every 30 seconds while the app is open

 • Option to jump straight to a certain toggle when the app is opened

...and all the usual refactoring (I can't help myself) and some protocol simplification. Here's a rule of thumb: if your AppMessage protocol uses arithmetic and nested switch statements, ditch it!

I also improved a lot of the Android code, added fail cases, and more logging etc. to better help me diagnose problems when a user sends me a debug log. Finally, I brought a little animation magic to the UI, and relied more heavily on system UI components instead of over-complicating things by rolling my own version of everything.
