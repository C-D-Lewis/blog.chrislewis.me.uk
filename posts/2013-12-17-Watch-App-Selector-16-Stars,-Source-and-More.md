Watch App Selector for Android just received a bumper update. It features a new layout, showing compatibility and source code availability:

Also included are a new watch app, Starfield Graphics Demo, as well as two new faces based on the demo: Starfield and Starfield Power Saver. The latter animates only once a second to save battery power.

Both are available on mypebblefaces, or with future updates and a whole bunch more stuff on Google Play as part of Watch App Selector:
