<strong>UPDATES: 

## - 1.2.0 shipped with an incorrect icon (d'oh!) and is now 1.2.1.

## - 1.2.2 Adds link to install from Pebble Appstore to combat Android Beta 10 sideloading bug. 

Today sees the addition of a number of new features to improve and expand the Wristponder experience:

• Added option to send to last Caller as well as last SMS.

• Added auto-close option in Settings.

• Added visual indicator of list usage.

• Added a guard to size when editing.

• Fixed a crash when a response was too long.


Here are some screenshots:

A few points regarding other requested features:

• Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Google Voice do not at the moment have APIs that allow background composition and sending of messages without user interaction. If I am incorrect, please let me know!

• Persistent storage of responses for faster launch on the watch is on the horizon, but it needs a few kinks ironed out first.

• Implementing a 'top 5 received SMS contacts' feature<del> is only possible for Android phones with API level 18 (Android 4.3) or greater, so not worth implementation just yet. Still a desirable feature though.</del> Appears to be doable! More soon.
