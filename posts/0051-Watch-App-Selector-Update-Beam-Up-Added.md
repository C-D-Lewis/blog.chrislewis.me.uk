A while ago<a title="New Watch Face: Beam Up" href="http://ninedof.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/new-watch-face-beam-up/"> I wrote</a> about a prototype watch face called Beam Up. Spurred on by the exciting potential the <a title="New App: Watch App Selector" href="http://ninedof.wordpress.com/2013/10/16/new-app-watch-app-selector/">Watch App Selector</a> now permits, I've finished it up.

It is exactly as it was before, but in addition to the predicted digit changes being done off-screen after being 'beamed up', there is a slim bar underneath the time display that show 15 second increments towards the minute ticking over, which then retracts fully in time with the digits change.

It's minimalist, but conveys a lot of information at the same time. I'm not very good at making mockup animated gifs, but here's a preview anyway of the minute change:

Enjoy!
