In a bit of downtime I thought I'd make myself a small app to give me local weather using PebbleKit JS to interpret a <a href="http://bbc.co.uk/weather" title="BBC Weather">BBC Weather</a> feed for my local town.

Quite stylish, I think! It's for personal use, as I have neither the time or energy to generalise it enough, and I'm sure there are plenty of weather apps out there already!
