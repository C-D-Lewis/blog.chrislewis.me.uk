Pi Rack v4

For the last couple of years, the Raspberry Pis that make up my house services
(lighting, dashboard, PiHole, DNS entry updater), network drive, and gaming
group Minecraft server have been running in a 3D printed rack of my own design
happily in the corner of my 'office' room. But, being my own design, it has
flaws of my own too.

The intention was that it allowed easy access to individual shelves for upgrades,
debugging, and other maintenance. As you can see, it looks cool, but there are a
couple of minor problems that were bothering me:

- It doesn't have room for the newly added Minecraft server (Pi 5 + NVMe Base), which is seen in the foreground.

- Warping from the 3D printing process means that shelves easily fall down onto others. It is also wobbly.

- Unless you're taking out the top Pi, you have to unplug all the others above the one being removed.

So, eventually I gave in and thought about ways to improve it. Initially I opted
for thickening all the parts and trying to route all cabled directly to the left
hand side of each shelf to solve the unplugging problem, but it was not smooth
sailing.

## Putting everything on one side

Once evening I had a brainwave - why not put the whole thing on its side, but
still have cables run top to bottom? This way individual shelves
(I would need a new name for those) can be easily removed without needing to
turn the whole lot off.

So I got back into TinkerCAD and after a few evenings of iteration had a basic
design. The 6 port USB power supply and Netgear switch would still be at the
bottom, but side by side. All power and network cables would then go up to meet
the individual Pis in their 'sleds' on the same level.

I was quite pleased with this outcome, and once again TinkerCAD's system of
grouping objects and shapes allowed me to play around with the virtual pieces to
make sure they fit together correctly, allowing for printing tolerances.

## Trying it out

I borrowed my brother's 3D printer (Crealty Ender Pro 3) and learned a great
deal from him about how it worked and how to maintain it. Most of it sunk in.
I printed the parts and filed off the brim burrs etc. and found that the result
was pretty good!

It was satisfying to slide each sled into place and see the whole come together.
Again I was unable to find a simple enough way to mount the OLED displays, so it
was glue a second time. But, they are cheap and can be reused.

Once problem I found was that somewhere between or in TinkerCAD or Cura slicing
software a certain interface between shapes produced crazy travel paths that
resulted in excess plastic on one layer and the hotend crashing into the part
and ruining the print.

Thankfully moving the hole a bit solved it.

Eventually it was all printed and assembled but I found cable management was a
problem - it was a mess!

This was solved by printing an additional layer that allowed all the power
and accessory cables for the network drive SSD adapters to be sanely routed to
the back.

## The final result

After some color-appropriate reprints (red for Cirroc network drive as always, green for Minecraft server)
and gluing the displays down, I'm quite proud of the final result. And in doing
the final stages I already enjoyed the much more convenience maintenance of
removing one sled at a time, so I'm confident that without a good reason this
could be the final form of this cluster's housing for quite some time.

Rather than design a complex press-fitting mechanism to join layers, or once
more mess around with fiddly nuts and bolts, I opted to just keep it in line
with some strong bulldog clips - simple, yet effective.

The final part was a short version of the main rack to use as a top retainer to
keep all the sleds tight in a line, but it turned out not to be required.
Still, it does tie it all together quite pleasingly.
