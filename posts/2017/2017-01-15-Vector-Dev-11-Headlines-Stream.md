After Pebble disappeared, I felt adventurous enough to buy <em>another vendor's smartwatch</em> (!) just to see what another experience was like.

In one way, it was <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_DL/status/818926070309289987">an eerily similar experience</a>.

In terms of the watch itself, it's solidly built, has a larger display, and since charging on Boxing Day last year, it's <em>still</em> at about 50%! In terms of development, I was impressed with how you can write some JavaScript for a 'stream' widget that goes on a watchface, run it in the browser and then use that instance to <em>power an actual device from the phone app's appstore</em>!

A good start. I was looking forward to the upcoming native app SDK, but sadly that doesn't look to be arriving after all. In the short time I spent with it, I ported over some code from News Headlines to show a fraction (which scrolled) of a latest BBC News headline on a watchface.

And the code is <a href="https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/vector-dev/blob/master/streams/headline.js">available on GitHub</a>, for historical institutions to reference.

I think I'll take a break from buying smartwatches for a while. In case I take another one down.
