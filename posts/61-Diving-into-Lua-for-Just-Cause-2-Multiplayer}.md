I've heard about the Lua language before, but never had the experience or drive to explore it, but now that I have lots of general experience and a love of Just Cause 2, I decided to give it a go.

The result, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/jc2-mp-cl), is a script for the JC2 MP server that implements player commands such as teleports, vehicle/weapon spawns and per-player home spawns. It also reads admin setting from a file as well as cause-specific death messages.

It has grown much over the last few days in collaboration with another writer, and hopefully it will become even more feature filled as I discover more about Lua.
