Here's a little something to take everybody's mind of things.

&nbsp;

This is a neat idea I had a while ago but only just got around to doing -

<em>"What would a map of all the interconnections and services that my Pebble apps rely upon look like?"</em>

Well, thanks to the neat tool that is Google Drawings, here it is. Scary dependencies!

Of course, this isn't the full picture. The Server Pi and Monitor Pi provide me with useful services I use in my day-to-day life, such as train delay timeline pins, weather alerts, and updates on the health of the services apps rely upon. Those details aren't shown here for brevity, but would increase the complexity of the drawing about 50%.
