Spark Core Pins from a Webpage

Building on the small amount of JavaScript code developed by controlling the Spark Core pins from my Pebble, I decided to write a basic webpage to allow me to perform the same control functions but from a browser. Sure, it's been done before, but as I have no real expertise or experience of JavaScript beyond that used for PebbleKit JS apps, and virtually none at all for HTML, it seemed like a good learning opportunity.

And it turned out to be easier than expected! After a couple of hours, the basic code was in place. The webpage looks like this:

<a href="http://ninedof.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/jquery-core.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1849" src="http://ninedof.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/jquery-core.png" alt="jQUery Core" width="483" height="372" /></a>Nothing too pretty to look at, but does the job well.

During the aforementioned Pebble project, <a href="https://community.spark.io/t/pin-argument-for-spark-function-is-always-0-solved/3794" title="Forum post">I sought help with a problem</a> in getting the same pin number back as I sent to the Spark Cloud. The solution to this turned out to be specifying the Spark.function() parameter string as a key-value dictionary, making the core (aha) code segment in this webpage as so:

<!-- language="js" -->
<code>
//Send the request to the Core
var sendRequest = function(pin, on, device_id, access_token) {
  var url;
  if(on) {
    url = "https://api.spark.io/v1/devices/" + device_id + "/on?access_token=" + access_token;
  } else {
    url = "https://api.spark.io/v1/devices/" + device_id + "/off?access_token=" + access_token;
  }

  console.log("jQuery AJAX: Requesting pin " + pin + " " + (on == true ? "on" : "off") + "...");

  //Send request using jQuert AJAX
  $.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: url,
    data: {"args":pin},
    success: success,
    dataType: "json"
  });
};
</code></pre>

The entire project (three files!) can be found on <a title="Source code" href="https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/core-pins-js/tree/master">GitHub here</a>. I may expand it to include more functions in the future, but at the moment it provides a good platform to play around with, and I've learned a small amount about HTML forms and using jQuery. Time well spent!
