Below is an example with no actions assigned for an acceleration threshold of 800 (g is approximately 1000), a minimum duration between firing actions and operating in the tilt mode :"

If no path connects them, I just touch for a new one until a valid one is found."

In <code>MODE_FLICK</code> a flick of the extended watchface-up wrist in each direction will trigger an abstract method to allow an action to be taken. Similarly in <code>MODE_TILT</code> the actions are triggered when the wrist is tilted left or right, or the arm is pointed up or down. The START button is used to start the data stream and the INSTALL button is used to install the streaming watchapp. The four black squares show the current actuating direction induced by the watch, and the first sample of the last received <code>AppMessage</code> (currently 5 samples per message) is shown at the bottom."
