This time around, any digit about to change gets 'beamed up' by an <code>InverterLayer</code>, changed, then replaced a moment later. Before I go into the interesting specifics, here's a preview image (although rather crudely created):"

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Now, in order to make sure only those digits that ARE about to change actually have the animation applied to them, we need to predict which ones are about to change. This is because the condition 'new digit does not equal old digit' (12:39 changing to 12:40) for example, can only be known once the new minute has elapsed at the seconds == 0 time. But by this time, the changed digit specific 'hide' animations are supposed to already have taken place! Hence the need for digit change prediction a second before, at seconds == 59 time."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "To do this, we look at each digit and the conditions under which each one will change. For example, for the '2' digit in '13:29', which I call 'minutes tens', the condition is that the 'minutes units' digit will be '9'. Thus, this is incremented behind the scenes to trigger the correct 'hide' animations before the time change has actually taken place. When the minute changes, the new time overwrites this little 'hack' and so synchrony is never lost to the user."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Similar conditions exist for the other two left hand digits. For the 'hours minutes', the condition is that  the 'minutes tens' digit is '5' and the 'minutes units' digit is '9' (12:59 for example)."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Finally, for the left hand most digit, 'hours tens', the condition is a little more complex. There are three times at which this digit changes.\n<ol>\n• At 09:59, it changes to a '1' in 10:00."
