After being connected, the door is marked as such, so that it cannot be chosen again. This has two downsides: 1 - There will always be a door that is the last one standing and permanently unconnected. This could be a room with one door. 2 - Paths cannot currently overlap, so it is somewhat messy.!<a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/assets/import/media/2013/03/connected-doors1.png\"></a>"

This is done by recognizing the 'passability' of tiles surrounding each tile and deciding on which type of layout it is.
