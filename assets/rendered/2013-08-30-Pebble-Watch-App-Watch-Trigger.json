This means you can do what you'd normally do when taking a timed photo, but you don't have to rush back to the group in ten seconds, you can press the watch button as quickly and discreetly as you want."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Once the app is installed, you can install the watch app by pressing the 'Install Watch App' button, then relaunch the Android app. As shown on the Pebble app, pressing SELECT will cause the phone to take a photo and save it to \"<del>/sdcard/Watch Trigger Images/ImageX.jpg</del>\" anywhere in the external storage you want. The name of the photo taken will then be confirmed on the phone and the watch, so you can go back and pick it up again:\n!<a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/assets/import/media/2013/08/shot11.png\"></a>!<a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/assets/import/media/2013/08/shot31.png\"></a>\n!<a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/assets/import/media/2013/08/watchapp.jpg\"></a>\nSo now it is possible to take a photo using the Pebble watch as a remote!"
