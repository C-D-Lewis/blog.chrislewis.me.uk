      "text": "So, seeing as I enjoy programming and system integration more than semi-conductor physics (Here's looking at you, exam!) I decided to find a new use for an old GDM1601c 16x1 LCD display from an old kit I had when I was younger."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "From experience (Digital Logic labs from the second year of university) I know that these types of displays have a standard interface, so it was easy enough to make whatever text I wanted come up on the display, especially with help from the Arduino LCD library, which replicates the protocol I reverse engineered (almost) in that second year lab experiment. If there's one thing you learn from practical electronic system integration, it's never to trust a datasheet!"

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The main quirk with this 'type' of display is that the memory locations for the left half and right half of the display are not analogous with their real world counterparts. This means that characters 1 - 8 are the 'top line' and characters 9 - 16 are the 'bottom line'. Apparently this means they are easier to manufacture (<a href=\"http://web.alfredstate.edu/weimandn/lcd/lcd_addressing/lcd_addressing_index.html\">source: this article</a>), and once again highlights the quirks of electronic manufacturing, another example being that CMOS logic used in most integrated circuits is all inverted (NAND instead of AND!). To get around this limitation (as can be seen in the source code attached), I wrote a function that decides how to display the input text based on its length. If its between 8 and 16, the function splits up the text into two halves, and draws them on the screen accordingly (Curse wordpress and not allowing indents in code sections!):"

After some experimentation with the <a href=\"http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/\">RXTX library</a> I got this to work, and it was a nice novelty to type something into the command prompt and see it appear instantaneously on the LCD display."
