It essentially cuts out the 'man in the middle' apps needed for communication with the web, which can limit the audience if the developer (such as myself!) is only familiar with one platform, such as Android."

      "text": "The idea I came up with was this: On the Transport for London website (<a title=\"TFL\" href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/\">tfl.gov.uk</a>), there is an HTML table that details the line status of all the different Underground lines. On a good business day these will all show 'Good service', and on a bad day/weekend a lot will show 'Part closure' or 'Planned closure'. Wouldn't it be great if this information was more readily available to a commuter or tourist if they happened to be equipped with a Pebble watch?"
