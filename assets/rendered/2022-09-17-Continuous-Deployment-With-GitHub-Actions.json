Including tests\n(of good quality) in the CI pipeline gives us confidence we can deploy more\nfrequently without fear of breaking things."

But I've not used\nit up to now, and it's much more tightly integrated with GitHub and doesn't need\ntwo extra services (CircleCI and Terraform Cloud) to achieve the automated\ndeployment aim."
