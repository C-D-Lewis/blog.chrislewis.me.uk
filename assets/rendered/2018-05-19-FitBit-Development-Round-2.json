      "text": "These apps were the two I was most looking forward to having completed on FitBit, since one replaces the extremely important ability to quickly see what meetings I have coming up that I got from Pebble timeline, and the other enables me to stay vaguely up to date with the world (this weekend's wedding excepting!) in small glimpses."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "So what's next? As mentioned in the last post, I'd like to try and get back to basics with some new watchface concepts, and also explore the possibility of beginning to bring some Dashboard functionality to FitBIt, depending on which data is available. I'm thinking web APIs for networks and battery level to get started, but sadly no actuation for the time being."
