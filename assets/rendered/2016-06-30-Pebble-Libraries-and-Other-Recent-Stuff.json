A lot of my apps and watchfaces contain modular elements that get reused. I also have a strange draw to making libraries, examples of which you can find in <a href=\"https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/pebble\">this handy GitHub README</a>."

I have to admit, cramming both screens into one Window with an animation between them does work very well, and is likely to be the status quo for some time to come."
