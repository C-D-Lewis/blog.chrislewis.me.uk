Not that I have anything to hide, but I do have some frightening stories from a few years ago, when people would come across my session and take the opportunity to be deviant (be it people who might be of the disposition to enjoy a good Facebook hijacking session, or kids back in school who would take the opportunity when I was at the printer to send a few more hundred pages for kicks)."

      "text": "So with that slight character flaw in mind, and the fact I'd recently created an authenticated Android -> PC link capable of executing anything at all, I had an idea for what I've named the One-Shot Wi-Fi Lock app. Put simply, it uses all the classes I've developed over the last couple of projects to connect to my laptop over Wi-Fi, send the CMD lock command, then disconnect and quit the app. My student house Wi-Fi address always appears to be static in the form 192.168.1.XX, so it is hard coded in as a String."
