I now work on frontend and backend projects and services instead of writing documentation for those at EVRYTHNG, and it's just about as varied, challenging, and rewarding as I expected, which is great. I've been working with many new libraries and technologies including:"

It's really neat to be able to version and review changes to spec files, then magically generate the same level of quality technical documentation instead of one person writing it all by hand. And of course, contributions to EVRYTHNG's <a href=\"https://github.com/evrythng/evrythng.js\">SDKs</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/evrythng/evrythng-cli\">open-source tools</a>."

As a result, all apps and faces are available for all devices, and as of yesterday I've finally started experimenting with the new Always on Display mode available to SDK based apps. Getting closer and closer to Pebble-like functionality!"

Unfortunately this meant that it had to be upgraded to a much newer SDK version. Which meant that extra measures had to be taken to continue to not be killed in the background. Luckily due to the code being open source I had some help. It's nice to see that app in action again after so long away from it:"
