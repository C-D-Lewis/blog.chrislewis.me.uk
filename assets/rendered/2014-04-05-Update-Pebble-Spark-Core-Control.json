I plan to release this app eventually, possibly under the name of PebbleTinker, derived from the stock <a title=\"Tinker\" href=\"http://docs.spark.io/#/start/tinkering-with-tinker\">Tinker app</a> for Spark Core, and all looks to be working fine, but I'm being haunted by the READY-TIMEOUT, where PebbleKit JS is killed after about ten seconds after install. Once this is fixed, I look forward to releasing!"
