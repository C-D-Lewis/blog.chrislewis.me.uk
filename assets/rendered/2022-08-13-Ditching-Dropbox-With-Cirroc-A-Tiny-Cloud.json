Up to\nthis point, the next best options were a multitude of smaller 'file sharing'\nsites that had limited hosting or were a pain to use and were not automated, or\nhanding a friend a USB stick. Emails could only contain attachments of up to a\nfew megabytes and around that time Google Mail began refusing attachments that\ncontained executable and archived files."

Over the years, I've grappled with some\nannoyances that have at times made me question if I really need to pay for\nit - most notably when after\n<a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/853236/how-to-make-dropbox-ignore-specific-folders-in-the-sync\">many years</a>\nthere is no such facility as a <code>.dropboxignore</code> to allow me to not\nsync thousands of files in <code>node_modules</code>, for example. A recent\nchange takes a step in the right direction, but is\n<a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://help.dropbox.com/files-folders/restore-delete/ignored-files\">not scalable</a>\nto dozens of Node.js projects, and other valid use cases also exist."
