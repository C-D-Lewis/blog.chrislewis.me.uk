      "text": "In this section of the tutorial I'll do an almost click by click run-through of how to set up a Virtual Machine running Ubuntu Linux for developing watch faces and apps. This will be without any screenshots because it's a very linear 'click next to continue' sort of process. If you get stuck, there are numerous guides that are Google-able to achieve this goal."

      "type": "paragraph",

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Again, if you would rather prefer not to do this you can use <a title=\"cloudpebble.net\" href=\"http://cloudpebble.net\">cloudpebble.net</a> to write the .c files and compile them, but it's always interesting to see a new facet of computing that you might not have done otherwise. It can also be said that this method of building watch faces and apps grants you more control, but it's up to  you."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "An advantage of using cloudpebble instead of installing your own Virtual Machine is that if you wanted only to modify an existing watch face and study the effects, that is a simpler option. You can focus on writing watch face code and compilation. For example, you can make a small modification to an existing watch face to save bothering the developer, but in most case I'd hope they would be happy to help, unless they were inundated with requests!"
