I've also created a few simple Live Wallpapers, but with these all the hard work is done for you by extending an existing class, <code>android.service.wallpaper.WallpaperService</code> (and in-turn extending <code>WallpaperService.Engine</code>)."

I had tried doing a similar <code>update() -> render() -> fpsDelay()</code> approach as in my Java games, but an endless loop such as this created in the Constructor of an Android app halts everything."
