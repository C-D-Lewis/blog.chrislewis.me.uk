      "text": "In terms of the watch itself, it's solidly built, has a larger display, and since charging on Boxing Day last year, it's <em>still</em> at about 50%! In terms of development, I was impressed with how you can write some JavaScript for a 'stream' widget that goes on a watchface, run it in the browser and then use that instance to <em>power an actual device from the phone app's appstore</em>!"

      "text": "A good start. I was looking forward to the upcoming native app SDK, but sadly that doesn't look to be arriving after all. In the short time I spent with it, I ported over some code from News Headlines to show a fraction (which scrolled) of a latest BBC News headline on a watchface."
